      <h2>Who I am</h2>
      <p>
        I am a backend-focused software engineer working primarily
        with C# and the .NET ecosystem.
        I enjoy working on systems that are already in production
        and need to evolve without breaking.

      <h2>How I think about software</h2>
      <p>
        I believe good software is shaped by constraints:
        existing users, existing data, and existing code.
        Most real-world systems are not greenfield,
        and design decisions must respect reality.

      <h2>About this blog</h2>
      <p>
        This blog is a collection of practical notes,
        architectural decisions, and real-world examples
        from backend development.
        The goal is clarity, not hype.
